# Risk-Detection-AI-Crawlers
This project is aimed to use web crawlers to detect risk in websites. This project will become a service used by a different project that detects overall security risk  for a company.

Certainly! Breaking down the project into sequential milestones with nested sub-milestones will help provide a structured approach to building your cybersecurity project using microservices. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

### Sequential List of Milestones

#### Milestone 1: Basic Web Crawling Service
- **Sub-Milestones:**
  1. Set up environment: Establish development environment with necessary tools (IDE, version control).
  2. Implement HTTP request handling: Create module to initiate HTTP requests to target websites.
  3. Fetch HTML content: Develop functionality to fetch and store HTML content of web pages.
  4. Extract basic elements: Implement extraction of basic elements such as text, links, and metadata.
  5. Store data: Store extracted data in a local database or flat files.
  6. Unit testing: Create unit tests to verify functionality of each component (e.g., HTTP requests, data extraction).

#### Milestone 2: Basic AI Analysis Module
- **Sub-Milestones:**
  1. Setup AI environment: Install necessary AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn) and dependencies.
  2. Implement basic pattern recognition: Develop algorithms to recognize common patterns (e.g., URLs with parameters).
  3. Anomaly detection: Integrate basic anomaly detection to identify unusual traffic or response patterns.
  4. Initial AI training: Train AI models on mock data to validate pattern recognition and anomaly detection.
  5. Unit testing: Test AI algorithms with synthetic data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### Milestone 3: Integration and API Development
- **Sub-Milestones:**
  1. Define API contracts: Design clear interfaces between web crawling and AI analysis modules.
  2. Implement API endpoints: Develop RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.
  3. Integration testing: Conduct integration tests to verify data flow and functionality between modules.
  4. Error handling and logging: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms for troubleshooting.
  5. Documentation: Document APIs, endpoints, and integration procedures for future reference.

#### Milestone 4: Advanced AI and Threat Detection
- **Sub-Milestones:**
  1. Implement advanced AI models: Integrate deep learning models for complex threat detection (e.g., neural networks for behavior analysis).
  2. Zero-day vulnerability detection: Develop algorithms for unsupervised learning to identify unknown vulnerabilities.
  3. Real-time monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring to detect and respond to threats as they emerge.
  4. Performance optimization: Optimize AI models and algorithms for scalability and real-time processing.
  5. System testing: Perform stress testing and simulated attack scenarios to validate threat detection capabilities.

#### Milestone 5: Automated Remediation and Reporting
- **Sub-Milestones:**
  1. Automated remediation scripts: Develop scripts or tools for automated patching of identified vulnerabilities.
  2. Reporting dashboard: Create a dashboard for visualizing security status, trends, and remediation efforts.
  3. Scheduled reports: Implement automated generation and delivery of periodic security reports.
  4. User feedback integration: Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve reporting and remediation features.
  5. Final testing and validation: Conduct end-to-end testing of automated remediation and reporting functionalities.

### Testing and Validation Approach

- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components within each sub-milestone to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between microservices and modules to confirm data flow and API functionality.
- **System Testing:** Verify the entire system's behavior under various scenarios, including simulated attacks and real-world usage.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve stakeholders and end-users to validate the system meets requirements and expectations.

### Additional Considerations

- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation throughout each milestone, including design decisions, APIs, testing procedures, and deployment instructions.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid iteration and deployment of updates.
- **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:** Continuously gather feedback from stakeholders and users to refine features, enhance security capabilities, and prioritize future enhancements.

By breaking down the project into these nested milestones, you can systematically build and test each component of your cybersecurity solution using microservices architecture. This approach ensures that each milestone is manageable, testable, and contributes to the overall success of the project, even when working alone.
